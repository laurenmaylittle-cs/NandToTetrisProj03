RAM512-16K should use the built in RAM gates
This is a project from my second year module "Computer Systems", there are 12 projects in this module where we start from a nand gate and end up building a tetris game. 
In this part of the project, we started with our previous gates as well as the ALU, and built up sequential logic and memory (Bit,Register,PC,RAM8,RAM64,RAM512,RAM4K,RAM16K)
